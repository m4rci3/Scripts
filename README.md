## Script Descriptions

These are scripts I made for NCyTE's VCCC. 

wp_db contains a 4 part script used to build and configure a wordpress `LAMP` (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP), these scripts are using the `yum` package manager , made for RHEL, Fedora and other RPM-based Linux distros such as Alma.  

db_dump contains a single script used to take a sql or mariadb database and dump its contents, additional details to have this script work properly are inside of the script's directory.
