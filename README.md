# Scripts
These are scripts I made for NCyTE's VCCC 
wp_db contains a 4 part script used to build and configure a wordpress LAMP stack to near completion. 

db_dump contains a single script used to take a sql or mariadb database and dump its contents, additional details to have this script work properly are inside of the script's directory.
